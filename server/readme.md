# Matflow Backend

This is a Django project that receives API requests with/without Celery, and sends responses.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

* **Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)**
* **Redis** (as the Celery broker)

---

## 2. Create Conda Environment

Create the environment from the provided `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate server
```

If you update the YAML later, sync your env with:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

## 3. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ml-cou/Matflow-nodebased-backend.git
