This is a Django project that receives API requests with/without Celery, and sends responses.

## Getting Started
To run this project with **Python 3.10** and **Celery**, follow these steps:

---

## 1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- **Python 3.10**

## 2. Verify Python Installation
Ensure Python 3.10 is installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```
If not installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

---

## 3. Setup Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment using Python 3.10:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv env
```
Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
